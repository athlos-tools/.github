# Athlos Tools

**Athlos Tools** is an open-source collection of tools to make sports and health wearable data more accessible and easy to work with.  

Different devices speak different languages â€” Garmin, Huawei, Fitbit, Polar, Apple, and many more. Our mission is to provide cross-platform solutions (e.g. *normalize*, *synchronize*) to handle all this data so developers, researchers, and many more can build freely without restrictions.  

## Main Repos
- **milo** â†’ the core library for data normalization.  
- *(more to come soon!)*
